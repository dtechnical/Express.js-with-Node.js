# Servers are the lifeblood of any network. They provide the shared resources that the network users need, such as e-mail, Web services, databases, file storage, etc.



A server is a computer or device that provides a service to another computer, device, or client.

Servers are often used to host websites, store data, and run applications, and they can be physical or virtual. 

When a client makes a request for a service, the server performs the necessary tasks and sends the results back to the client.

Some examples of servers include web servers, database servers, file servers, and application servers.
